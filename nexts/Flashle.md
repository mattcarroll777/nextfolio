Flashle is an engaging and educational web app built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. It's a fun, interactive game that helps users improve their memory and knowledge by challenging them to guess the names of famous individuals based on image clues. Flashle features a progressive hints for incorrect guesses as well as an interfaced based on the viral game Wordle. A significant challenge was designing the progressive hints and name-guessing interface. I addressed this by implementing a hint system that reveals a fact about the card in play and saving letters in the name with each incorrect guess, creating a sense of progression and engagement.
Technologies used: Next.JS, React, Vercel, Javascript/Node and CSS.
