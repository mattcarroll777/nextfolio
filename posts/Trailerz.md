Trailerz was my first project in my Google User Experience Design Course. I was prompted to create a mobile application for watching movie trailers. I began by defining the main user flow as, "someone trying to find a moive trailer to watch or show a friend." Then I ideated using paper and digital wireframing, conducted usabilitlty studies, low and high-fideltiy prototyping and continous iterations to create my final designs.
