MyMedJournal was my capstone project in my Google User Exeperience Design Course. I was challeneged to put all my design knowledge together to create a responsive web app and a companion mobile app for social good. My idea was to create an application that allowed users to track their moods when preforming nomral activities such as sleep, exercise, diet. This application will track correlations and relay it back to the user along with any medical perfessinol who is provided access to it.
