As the culminating challenge in my Google UX Design course, I was tasked with amalgamating the gamut of design principles acquired during my journey. The outcome was "MyMedJournal", a dual-platform solution with a responsive web application and its mobile counterpart. The primary vision? To drive social good by providing users with insights into their well-being, tracking the interplay of routine activities on their moods. Parts of this project to highlight are the Holistic Health Tracking, my project delves beyond mere mood logging. It discerns the nuanced effects of daily activities such as sleep, exercise, and diet on an individual's emotional well-being. MyMedJournal Harnesses the power of data analytics, the application underscores correlations, empowering users to understand patterns and potential triggers that might affect their mood. With an emphasis on comprehensive health, a feature will be intergrated allowing medical professionals to access these insights (with user consent). This bridges the gap between self-awareness and professional medical guidance.
