"For one of our key projects at Fullstack Academy, my team of four, including myself, developed an ecommerce store specializing in expensive chocolate. Dubbed 'GraceShopper', this project was an exercise in collaborative development and efficient project management. We divided the workload into vertical slices, coordinating our efforts using a Git workflow and a Kanban board, which facilitated seamless teamwork and task tracking. The store was built using a tech stack comprising React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize with PostgreSQL, chosen for their robustness and scalability in web application development.

The project was initially deployed on Heroku, demonstrating our ability to manage and deploy a full-stack application effectively. A significant feature of our site was the user authentication process, secured using JSON Web Tokens and bcrypt, ensuring a secure and reliable user experience. Additionally, we implemented a persistent cart functionality, which maintained the user's cart state even after logging off, enhancing the overall usability and customer experience of the ecommerce platform."
