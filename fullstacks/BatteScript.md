In our capstone project at Fullstack Academy, my team and I developed 'BattleScript', an innovative coding game where 2-8 players compete to solve coding problems. Inspired by the interactive style of Jackbox games, BattleScript challenges players to write code under timed conditions. After each round, players vote on whose code solution they find most effective, adding a collaborative and competitive edge to the learning process.

A key feature of our game is the real-time code testing, where players' submissions are evaluated using iFrames and validated through Mocha/Chai tests, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. To build this interactive platform, we ventured into learning a new technology, Colyseus, a framework that was crucial in managing the game state. It seamlessly connected the front-end and back-end, enabling consistent rendering across different game stages. Moreover, we utilized web sockets to establish real-time messaging between players, enhancing the dynamic and engaging nature of BattleScript. This project not only tested our coding skills but also our ability to quickly adapt to and implement new technologies in a collaborative environment.
