"Chatbots and their Implications of the World of Migration," was my final research paper to finish my bachleors degree. A 14 page dive into how chatbots negativley and positivley affect migrant populaitons around the global. My research concludes that chatbots could be a benefit to migrants as long as certian negative aspects such as chatbots and security concerns are mitigated.
