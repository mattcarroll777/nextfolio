For my bachelor's degree capstone, I undertook an in-depth, 14-page exploration into the multifaceted impact of chatbots on global migrant populations. My research delved into both the promising potentials and the underlying challenges posed by this burgeoning technology. I identified several ways chatbots can be invaluable tools for migrants, ranging from real-time language translation, assistance in navigating bureaucratic hurdles, to providing valuable resources and support in unfamiliar territories, such as finding housing and employment. The research also highlighted critical issues such as algorithmic biases which might unintentionally marginalize certain groups. Further, I discussed concerns related to the security and privacy of data, especially given the vulnerable position many migrants find themselves in and the potential loss of low-skilled labor which is the primary employment of migrants and could be effected by the rise of AI. I concluded that while chatbots hold significant promise as tools for aiding migrants, their effective deployment requires proactive steps to curtail biases and uphold robust security measures. Only with these considerations in place can we ensure that the technology serves as a force for good in the context of global migration.
